char botd[] = "A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness.\n\
              The scope and content of the experience is limitless, but its characteristic\n\
              features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of space-time\n\
              dimensions, and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged\n\
              consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory deprivation, yoga\n\
              exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or\n\
              spontaneously. Most recently they have become available to anyone through\n\
              the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT,\n\
              etc. [This is the statement of an ideal, not an actual situation, in 1964. The\n\
              psychedelic drugs are in the United States classified as \"experimental\"\n\
              drugs. That is, they are not available on a prescription basis, but only to\n\
              \"qualified investigators.\" The Federal Food and Drug Administration has\n\
              defined \"qualified investigators\" to mean psychiatrists working in a mental\n\
              hospital setting, whose research is sponsored by either state or federal\n\
              agencies.]\n\
              \
              Of course, the drug dose does not produce the transcendent experience. It\n\
              merely acts as a chemical key - it opens the mind, frees the nervous system\n\
              of its ordinary patterns and structures. The nature of the experience depends\n\
              almost entirely on set and setting. Set denotes the preparation of the\n\
              individual, including his personality structure and his mood at the time.\n\
              Setting is physical - the weather, the room's atmosphere; social - feelings\n\
              of persons present towards one another; and cultural - prevailing views as\n\
              to what is real. It is for this reason that manuals or guide-books are\n\
              necessary. Their purpose is to enable a person to understand the new\n\
              realities of the expanded consciousness, to serve as road maps for new\n\
              interior territories which modern science has made accessible.\n\
              \
              Different explorers draw different maps. Other manuals are to be written\n\
              based on different models - scientific, aesthetic, therapeutic. The Tibetan\n\
              model, on which this manual is based, is designed to teach the person to\n\
              direct and control awareness in such a way as to reach that level of\n\
              understanding variously called liberation, illumination, or enlightenment. If\n\
              the manual is read several times before a session is attempted, and if a\n\
              trusted person is there to remind and refresh the memory of the voyager\n\
              during the experience, the consciousness will be freed from the games\n\
              which comprise \"personality\" and from positive-negative hallucinations\n\
              which often accompany states of expanded awareness. The Tibetan Book of\n\
              the Dead was called in its own language the Bardo Thodol, which means\n\
              \"Liberation by Hearing on the After-Death Plane.\" The book stresses over and\n\
              over that the free consciousness has only to hear and remember the\n\
              teachings in order to be liberated.\n\
              \
              The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences\n\
              to be expected at the moment of death, during an intermediate phase lasting\n\
              forty-nine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another bodily\n\
              frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan\n\
              Buddhists used to cloak their mystical teachings. The language and\n\
              symbolism of death rituals of Bonism, the traditional pre-Buddhist Tibetan\n\
              religion, were skillfully blended with Buddhist conceptions. The esoteric\n\
              meaning, as it has been interpreted in this manual, is that it is death and\n\
              rebirth that is described, not of the body. Lama Govinda indicates this\n\
              clearly in his introduction when he writes: \"It is a book for the living as\n\
              well as the dying.\" The book's esoteric meaning is often concealed beneath\n\
              many layers of symbolism. It was not intended for general reading. It was\n\
              designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by\n\
              a guru into the Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the pre-mortem-death-\n\
              rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a closely guarded secret\n\
              for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do\n\
              harm. In translating such an esoteric text, therefore, there are two steps:\n\
              one, the rendering of the original text into English; and two, the practical\n\
              interpretation of the text for its uses. In publishing this practical\n\
              interpretation for use in the psychedelic drug session, we are in a sense\n\
              breaking with the tradition of secrecy and thus contravening the teachings\n\
              of the lama-gurus.\n\
              \
              However, this step is justified on the grounds that the manual will not be\n\
              understood by anyone who has not had a consciousness-expanding\n\
              experience and that there are signs that the lamas themselves, after their\n\
              recent diaspora, wish to make their teachings available to a wider public.\n\
              \
              Following the Tibetan model then, we distinguish three phases of the\n\
              psychedelic experience. The first period (Chikhai Bardo) is that of complete\n\
              transcendence - beyond words, beyond space-time, beyond self. There are\n\
              no visions, no sense of self, no thoughts. There are only pure awareness and\n\
              ecstatic freedom from all game (and biological) involvements. [\"Games\" are\n\
              behavioral sequences defined by roles, rules, rituals, goals, strategies,\n\
              values, language, characteristic space-time locations and characteristic\n\
              patterns of movement. Any behavior not having these nine features is non-\n\
              game: this includes physiological reflexes, spontaneous play, and\n\
              transcendent awareness.] The second lengthy period involves self, or\n\
              external game reality (Chonyid Bardo) - in sharp exquisite clarity or in the\n\
              form of hallucinations (karmic apparitions). The final period (Sidpa Bardo)\n\
              involves the return to routine game reality and the self. For most persons\n\
              the second (aesthetic or hallucinatory) stage is the longest. For the initiated\n\
              the first stage of illumination lasts longer. For the unprepared, the heavy\n\
              game players, those who anxiously cling to their egos, and for those who\n\
              take the drug in a non-supportive setting, the struggle to regain reality\n\
              begins early and usually lasts to the end of their session.\n\
              \
              Words like these are static, whereas the psychedelic experience is fluid and\n\
              ever-changing. Typically the subject's consciousness flicks in and out of\n\
              these three levels with rapid oscillations. One purpose of this manual is to\n\
              enable the person to regain the transcendence of the First Bardo and to avoid\n\
              prolonged entrapments in hallucinatory or ego-dominated game patterns.\n\
              \
              The Basic Trusts and Beliefs.  You must be ready to accept the possibility\n\
              that there is a limitless range of awareness for which we now have no\n\
              words; that awareness can expand beyond range of your ego, your self, your\n\
              familiar identity, beyond everything you have learned, beyond your notions\n\
              of space and time, beyond the differences which usually separate people\n\
              from each other and from the world around them.\n\
              \
              You must remember that throughout human history, millions have made this\n\
              voyage. A few (whom we call mystics, saints or buddhas) have made this\n\
              experience endure and have communicated it to their fellow men. You must\n\
              remember, too, that the experience is safe (at the very worst, you will end\n\
              up the same person who entered the experience), and that all of the dangers\n\
              which you have feared are unnecessary productions of your mind. Whether\n\
              you experience heaven or hell, remember that it is your mind which creates\n\
              them. Avoid grasping the one or fleeing the other. Avoid imposing the ego\n\
              game on the experience.\n\
              \
              You must try to maintain faith and trust in the potentiality of your own\n\
              brain and the billion-year-old life process. With you ego left behind you, the\n\
              brain can't go wrong.\n\
              \
              Try to keep the memory of a trusted friend or a respected person whose\n\
              name can serve as a guide and protection.\n\
              \
              Trust your divinity, trust your brain, trust your companions.\n\
              \
              Whenever in doubt, turn off your mind, relax, float downstream.\n\
              \
              After reading this guide, the prepared person should be able, at the very\n\
              beginning of his experience, to move directly to a state of non-game ecstasy\n\
              and deep revelation. But if you are not well prepared, or if there is game\n\
              distraction around you, you will find yourself dropping back. If this happens,\n\
              then the instructions in Part IV should help you regain and maintain\n\
              liberation.\n\
              \
              \"Liberation in this context does not necessarily imply (especially in the case\n\
              of the average person) the Liberation of Nirvana, but chiefly a liberation of\n\
              the 'life-flux' from the ego, in such a manner as will afford the greatest\n\
              possible consciousness and consequent happy rebirth. Yet for the very\n\
              experienced and very highly efficient person, the [same] esoteric process of\n\
              Transference [Readers interested in a more detailed discussion of the\n\
              process of \"Transference\" are referred to Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines,\n\
              edited by W. Y. Evans-Wentz, Oxford University Press, 1958.] can be,\n\
              according to the lama-gurus, so employed as to prevent any break in the\n\
              flow of the stream of consciousness, from the moment of the ego-loss to\n\
              the moment of a conscious rebirth (eight hours later). Judging from the\n\
              translation made by the late Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup, of an old Tibetan\n\
              manuscript containing practical directions for ego-loss states, the ability\n\
              to maintain a non-game ecstasy throughout the entire experience is\n\
              possessed only by persons trained in mental concentration, or one-\n\
              pointedness of mind, to such a high degree of proficiency as to be able to\n\
              control all the mental functions and to shut out the distractions of the\n\
              outside world.\" (Evans-Wentz, p. 86, note 2)\n\
              \
              This manual is divided into four parts. The first part is introductory. The\n\
              second is a step-by-step description of a psychedelic experience based\n\
              directly on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The third part contains practical\n\
              suggestions on how to prepare for and conduct a psychedelic session. The\n\
              fourth part contains instructive passages adapted from the Bardo Thodol,\n\
              which may be read to the voyager during this session, to facilitate the\n\
              movement of consciousness.\n\
              \
              In the remainder of this introductory section, we review three\n\
              commentaries on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, published with the Evans-\n\
              Wentz edition. These are the introduction by Evans-Wentz himself, the\n\
              distinguished translator-editor of four treatises on Tibetan mysticism; the\n\
              commentary by Carl Jung, the Swiss psychoanalyst; and by Lama Govinda,\n\
              and initiate of one of the principle Buddhist orders of Tibet.\n\
              \
              Part I: The Primary Clear Light Seen At the Moment of Ego-Loss.\n\
              All individuals who have received the practical teachings of this manual \n\
              will, if the text be remembered, be set face to face with the ecstatic \n\
              radiance and will win illumination instantaneously, without entering upon \n\
              hallucinatory struggles and without further suffering on the age-long \n\
              pathway of normal evolution which traverses the various worlds of game \n\
              existence.\n\
              \
              This doctrine underlies the whole of the Tibetan model. Faith is the first \n\
              step on the \"Secret Pathway.\" Then comes illumination and with it certainty; \n\
              and when the goal is won, emancipation. Success implies very unusual \n\
              preparation in consciousness expansion, as well as much calm, \n\
              compassionate game playing (good karma) on the part of the participant. If \n\
              the participant can be made to see and to grasp the idea of the empty mind \n\
              as soon as the guide reveals it - that is to say, if he has the power to die \n\
              consciously - and, at the supreme moment of quitting the ego, can recognize \n\
              the ecstasy which will dawn upon him then, and become one with it, all \n\
              game bonds of illusion are broken asunder immediately: the dreamer is \n\
              awakened into reality simultaneously with the mighty achievement of \n\
              recognition.\n\
              \
              It is best if the guru (spiritual teacher), from whom the participant received\n\
              guiding instructions, is present, but if the guru cannot be present, then\n\
              another experienced person; or it the latter is also unavailable, then a\n\
              person whom the participant trusts should be available to read this manual\n\
              without imposing any of his own games. Thereby the participant will be put\n\
              in mind of what he had previously heard of the experience and will at once\n\
              come to recognize the fundamental Light and undoubtedly obtain liberation.\n\
              \
              Liberation is the nervous system devoid of mental-conceptual activity.\n\
              [Realization of the Voidness, the Unbecome, the Unborn, the Unmade, the\n\
              Unformed, implies Buddhahood, Perfect Enlightenment - the state of the\n\
              divine mind of the Buddha. It may be helpful to remember that this ancient\n\
              doctrine is not in conflict with modern physics. The theoretical physicist\n\
              and cosmologist, George Gamow, presented in 1950 a viewpoint which is\n\
              close to the phenomenological experience described by the Tibetan lamas.\n\
              \
              If we imagine history running back in time, we inevitably come to the epoch\n\
              of the \"big squeeze\" with all the galaxies, stars, atoms and atomic nuclei\n\
              squeezed, so to speak, to a pulp. During that early stage of evolution, matter\n\
              must have been dissociated into its elementary components. . . . We call this\n\
              primordial mixture ylem.\n\
              \
              At this first point in the evolution of the present cycle, according to this\n\
              first-rank physicist, there existed only the Unbecome, the Unborn, the\n\
              Unformed. And this, according to astrophysicists, is the way it will end; the\n\
              silent unity of the Unformed. The Tibetan Buddhists suggest that the\n\
              uncluttered intellect can experience what astrophysics confirms. The\n\
              Buddha Vairochana, the Dhyani Buddha of the Center, Manifester of\n\
              Phenomena, is the highest path to enlightenment. As the source of all\n\
              organic life, in him all things visible and invisible have their consummation\n\
              and absorption. He is associated with the Central Realm of the Densely-\n\
              Packed, i.e., the seed of all universal forces and things are densely packed\n\
              together. This remarkable convergence of modern astrophysics and ancient\n\
              lamaism demands no complicated explanation. The cosmological awareness-\n\
              and awareness of every other natural process- is there in the cortex. You can\n\
              confirm this preconceptual mystical knowledge by empirical observation and\n\
              measurement, but it's all there inside your skull. Your neurons \"know\"\n\
              because they are linked directly to the process, are part of it.] The mind in\n\
              its conditioned state, that is to say, when limited to words and ego games,\n\
              is continuously in thought-formation activity. The nervous system in a state\n\
              of quiescence, alert, awake but not active is comparable to what Buddhists\n\
              call the highest state of dhyana (deep meditation) when still united to a\n\
              human body. The conscious recognition of the Clear Light induces an ecstatic\n\
              condition of consciousness such as saints and mystics of the West have\n\
              called illumination.\n\
              \
              The first sign is the glimpsing of the \"Clear Light of Reality,\" the infallible\n\
              mind of the pure mystic state. This is the awareness of energy\n\
              transformations with no imposition of mental categories.\n\
              \
              The duration of this state varies with the individual. It depends upon\n\
              experience, security, trust, preparation and the surroundings. In those who\n\
              have had even a little practical experience of the tranquil state of non-game\n\
              awareness, and in those who have happy games, this state can last from\n\
              thirty minutes to several hours.\n\
              \
              In this state, realization of what mystics call the \"Ultimate Truth\" is\n\
              possible, provided that sufficient preparation has been made by the person\n\
              beforehand. Otherwise he cannot benefit now, and must wander on into\n\
              lower and lower conditions of hallucinations, as determined by his past\n\
              games, until he drops back to routine reality.\n\
              \
              It is important to remember that the conscious-expansion process is the\n\
              reverse of the birth process, birth being the beginning of game life and the\n\
              ego-loss experience being a temporary ending of game life. But in both there\n\
              is a passing from one state of consciousness into another. And just as an\n\
              infant must wake up and learn from experience the nature of this world, so\n\
              likewise a person at the moment of consciousness expansion must wake up\n\
              in this new brilliant world and become familiar with its own peculiar\n\
              conditions.\n\
              \
              In those who are heavily dependent on their ego games, and who dread\n\
              giving up their control, the illuminated state endures only so long as it\n\
              would take to snap a finger. In some, it lasts as long as the time taken for\n\
              eating a meal.\n\
              \
              If the subject is prepared to diagnose the symptoms of ego loss, he needs no\n\
              outside help at this point. Not only should the person about to give up his\n\
              ego be able to diagnose the symptoms as they come, one by one, but he\n\
              should also be able to recognize the Clear Light without being set face to\n\
              face with it by another person. If the person fails to recognize and accept\n\
              the onset of ego loss, he may complain of strange bodily symptoms. This\n\
              shows that he has not reached a liberated state. Then the guide or friend\n\
              should explain the symptoms as indicating the onset of ego loss.\n\
              \
              Here is a list of commonly reported physical sensations:\n\

              1. Bodily pressure, which the Tibetans call earth-sinking-into-water,\n\
              2. Clammy coldness, followed by feverish heat, which the Tibetans call\n\
              water-sinking-into-fire,\n\
              3. Body disintegrating or blown to atoms, called fire-sinking-into-air,\n\
              4. Pressure on head and ears, which Americans call rocket-launching-into-\n\
              space,\n\
              5. Tingling in extremities,\n\
              6. Feelings of body melting or flowing as if wax,\n\
              7. Nausea,\n\
              8. Trembling or shaking, beginning in pelvic regions and spreading up torso.\n\
              \
              These physical reactions should be recognized as signs heralding\n\
              transcendence. Avoid treating them as symptoms of illness, accept them,\n\
              merge with them, enjoy them.\n\
              \
              Mild nausea occurs often with the ingestion of morning-glory seeds or\n\
              peyote, rarely with mescaline and infrequently with LSD or psilocybin. If the\n\
              subject experiences stomach messages, they should be hailed as a sign that\n\
              consciousness is moving around in the body. The symptoms are mental; the\n\
              mind controls the sensation, and the subject should merge with the\n\
              sensation, experience it fully, enjoy it and, having enjoyed it, let\n\
              consciousness flow on to the next phase. It is usually more natural to let\n\
              consciousness stay in the body - the subject's attention can move from the\n\
              stomach and concentrate on breathing, heart beat. If this does not free him\n\
              from nausea, the guide should move the consciousness to external events -\n\
              music, walking in the garden, etc.\n\
              \
              The appearance of physical symptoms of ego-loss, recognized and\n\
              understood, should result in peaceful attainment of illumination. If ecstatic\n\
              acceptance does not occur (or when the period of peaceful silence seems to\n\
              be ending), the relevant sections of the instructions can be spoken in a low\n\
              tone of voice in the ear. It is often useful to repeat them distinctly, clearly\n\
              impressing them upon the person so as to prevent his mind from wandering.\n\
              Another method of guiding the experience with a minimum of activity is to\n\
              have the instructions previously recorded in the subject's own voice and to\n\
              flip the tape on at the appropriate moment. The reading will recall to the\n\
              mind of the voyager the former preparation; it will cause the naked\n\
              consciousness to be recognized as the \"Clear Light of the Beginning;\" it will\n\
              remind the subject of his unity with this state of perfect enlightenment and\n\
              help him to maintain it.\n\
              \
              If, when undergoing ego-loss, one is familiar with this state, by virtue of\n\
              previous experience and preparation, the Wheel of Rebirth (i.e., all game\n\
              playing) is stopped, and liberation instantaneously is achieved. But such\n\
              spiritual efficiency is so very rare, that the normal mental condition of the\n\
              person is unequal to the supreme feat of holding on to the state in which the\n\
              Clear Light shines; and there follows a progressive descent into lower and\n\
              lower states of the Bardo existence, and then rebirth. The simile of a needle\n\
              balanced and set rolling on a thread is used by the lamas to elucidate this\n\
              condition. So long as the needle retains its balance, it remains on the thread.\n\
              Eventually, however, the law of gravitation (the pull of the ego or external\n\
              stimulation) affects it, and it falls. In the realm of the Clear Light,\n\
              similarly, the mentality of a person in the ego-transcendent state\n\
              momentarily enjoys a condition of balance, of perfect equilibrium, and of\n\
              oneness. Unfamiliar with such a state, which is an ecstate state of non-ego,\n\
              the consciousness of the average human being lacks the power to function in\n\
              it. Karmic (i.e., game) propensities becloud the consciousness-principle with\n\
              thoughts of personality, of individualized being, of dualism. Thus, losing\n\
              equilibrium, consciousness falls away from the Clear Light. It is thought\n\
              processes which prevent the realization of Nirvana (which is the \"blowing\n\
              out of the flame\" of selfish game desire); and so the Wheel of Life continues\n\
              to turn.\n\
              \
              All or some of the appropriate passages in the instructions may be read to\n\
              the voyager during the period of waiting for the drug to take effect, and\n\
              when the first symptoms of ego-loss appear. When the voyager is clearly in\n\
              a profound ego-transcendent ecstasy, the wise guide will remain silent.\n\0";
