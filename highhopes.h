char high_hopes[] = " Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young\n\
                      In a world of magnets and miracles\n\
                      Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary\n\
                      The ringing of the division bell had begun\n\
                      Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway\n\
                      Do they still meet there by the Cut\n\
                      There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps\n\
                      Running before times took our dreams away\n\
                      Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground\n\
                      To a life consumed by slow decay\n\
                      The grass was greener\n\
                      The light was brighter\n\
                      When friends surrounded\n\
                      The nights of wonder\n\
                      Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us\n\
                      To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side\n\
                      Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again\n\
                      Dragged by the force of some inner tide\n\
                      At a higher altitude with flag unfurled\n\
                      We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world\n\
                      Encumbered forever by desire and ambition\n\
                      There's a hunger still unsatisfied\n\
                      Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon\n\
                      Though down this road we've been so many times\n\
                      The grass was greener\n\
                      The light was brighter\n\
                      The taste was sweeter\n\
                      The nights of wonder\n\
                      With friends surrounded\n\
                      The dawn mist glowing\n\
                      The water flowing\n\
                      The endless river\n\
                      Forever and ever\n\0";
